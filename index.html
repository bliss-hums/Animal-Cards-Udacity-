			<p>The oldest recorded bald eagle in the wild was at least 38 years old when it was hit and killed by a car 
                in New York in 2015. It had been banded in the same state in 1977.

			<p>These regal birds aren’t really bald, but their white-feathered heads gleam in contrast to their chocolate-brown body and wings. Look for them soaring in solitude, chasing other birds for their food, or gathering by the hundreds in winter.
               Once endangered by hunting and pesticides, Bald Eagles have flourished under protection.
